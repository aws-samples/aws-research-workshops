# Getting Started

## Create an AWS account

In order to complete these workshops, you'll need a valid, usable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/" target="_blank">AWS Account</a>. Use a personal account or create a new AWS account to ensure you have the necessary access and that you do not accidentally modify corporate resources. Do **not** use an AWS account from the company you work for. 

## Create an admin user

If you don't already have an AWS IAM user with admin permissions, please use the following instructions to create one:

1.  Browse to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank">AWS IAM</a> console.
2.  Click **Users** on the left navigation and then click **Add User**.
3.  Enter a **User Name**, check the checkbox for **AWS Management Console access**, enter a **Custom Password**, and click **Next:Permissions**.
4.  Click **Attach existing policies directly**, click the checkbox next to the **AdministratorAccess**, and click **Next:review**.
5.  Click **Create User**
6.  Click **Dashboard** on the left navigation and use the **IAM users sign-in link** to login as the admin user you just created.

## Add credits (optional)

If you are doing this workshop as part of an AWS sponsored event, you will receive credits to cover the costs.  Below are the instructions for entering the credits:

1.  Browse to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/credits" target="_blank">AWS Account Settings</a> console.
2.  Enter the **Promo Code** you received (these will be handed out at the beginning of the workshop).
3.  Enter the **Security Check** and click **Redeem**.

You are now setup for the workshops!
