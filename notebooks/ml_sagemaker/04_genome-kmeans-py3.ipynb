    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker allows you to bring powerful machine learning workflows to data that is already in the cloud.  In this example, we will do just that - combining Amazon SageMaker with data from the [1000 Genomes Project] which is hosted by AWS as a [public dataset].  Specifically, we will perform unsupervised learning using Amazon SageMaker's KMeans algorithm to see if we can predict the geographic population for a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs (pronounced \"snips\") are single base-pair changes to DNA.  DNA is a long chain molecule that is used to store the \"source code\" for all living organisms and is \"read\" as a sequence of four nucleotides: A, T, C, and G.  A single letter is called a \"base\".  SNPs occur when one of these bases in the sequence changes due to environmental causes or random replication errors during cell division in germ cells (eggs and sperm).  Sometimes these changes are harmless, and sometimes they can cause serious diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to cluster high frequency SNPs found on Chromosome 6\n",
